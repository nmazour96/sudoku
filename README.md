# sudoku
This is a program that will generate sudoku puzzles and their solutions.

We are choosing to write code that will generate difficult Sudoku problems. We will be using the Numberjack library to assist us. We will most likely create a custom class to generate the grid for the game. The user doesnâ€™t have to input anything. The program will generate a solvable Sudoku problem and its solution. It will print lists that are in the form of a Sudoku grid. It will also have a check that the problem is solvable before printing it.
